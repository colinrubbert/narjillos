/**
 * Runs a short experiment for a few thousands ticks and times the result.
 * It also prints an error message to get your attention in case the test
 * takes longer than a rule-of-thumb performance level (on my computer, 4000
 * ticks under 10 seconds).
 * 
 * It can be also run as a unit test. In this case, it goes through way fewer ticks,
 * so it's faster. This is by its very nature a nondeterministic test that can fail
 * randomly, or fail consistently on slower or overloaded machines - so it shouldn't
 * be run as part of an official build. But it's useful while developing, to catch
 * slowdowns as early as possible - so it's a good idea to put it in the local build
 * (assuming that your computer is exactly as fast as mine).
